**Narrative**
-------------

Imagine a student preparing for finals who has been diligently taking notes but is unsure how well they've retained the material. Instead of using generic online quizzes, they upload their own notes to QuizNote. Within seconds, the platform generates a personalized quiz, providing real-time feedback and pinpointing areas that need more attention. This saves time, provides more relevant insights, and boosts confidence for the upcoming exam. QuizNote transforms passive note-taking into an active, personalized learning experience.

**Technical Considerations**
----------------------------

-   **OpenAI API Integration**: Ensure the OpenAI API can effectively process and convert user notes into quizzes. Test for accurate question generation, while managing API rate limits and usage costs.
-   **File Handling**: Support for multiple file formats, including extracting text from PDFs and DOCX files, ensuring smooth data processing.
-   **Question Generation**: The AI-generated questions should be high quality, covering different question types (multiple-choice, short-answer, true/false) based on the user's uploaded content.
-   **Scalability**: Design the platform to handle large volumes of note uploads and simultaneous test generations without significant lag or downtime.
-   **User Progress & Data**: Ensure secure storage of user data, including notes and quiz history, and create a user-friendly dashboard for tracking progress.

**Potential Risks & Mitigations**
---------------------------------

-   **Question Quality**: The OpenAI-generated questions may not always match the expected difficulty or specificity. To mitigate this, continuous fine-tuning of the prompts and periodic user testing will be needed.
-   **File Parsing Issues**: PDFs or complex DOCX files might not always parse correctly. Consider adding manual text entry or a robust file parser to improve accuracy.
-   **User Engagement Drop-Off**: If quizzes don't provide enough value or insight, users might not return. Focus on improving feedback quality and personalization to keep users engaged.

* * * * *

**Open Questions**
------------------

1.  Should we introduce gamification elements like badges or leaderboards to increase engagement, or would this distract from the learning focus?
2.  How important is it to offer various quiz formats (e.g., timed vs untimed quizzes) at launch, or can that be part of a later release?
3.  Should we prioritize mobile responsiveness early in the development, given the target audience of students who may prefer mobile access?
